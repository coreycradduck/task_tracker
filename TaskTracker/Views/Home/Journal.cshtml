<p>
    C# lambda expressions are weird.  Practice more.  Create a partial view of the top 5 recent timer items in the HomeController Index view.  Create more interactivity between start/stop timer buttons.  
    Tag cloud functionality with drag and drop attributes?  I don't even know how that would work... for each tag attribute associated, commit new record to timer.  
    Expand tag functionality to have project/task/skill?
